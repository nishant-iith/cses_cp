# CSES Problem Set: Longest Repetition

## Task

You are given a DNA sequence: a string consisting of characters $$A$$, $$C$$, $$G$$, and $$T$$. Your task is to find the longest repetition in the sequence. This is a maximum-length substring containing only one type of character.

## Input

- The only input line contains a string of $$n$$ characters.

### Constraints:
- $$1 \le n \le 10^6$$

## Output

Print one integer: the length of the longest repetition.

## Example

### Input:
ATTCGGGA


### Output:
3

---

### Notes:
- The sequence contains only the characters $$A$$, $$C$$, $$G$$, and $$T$$.
- The solution must be efficient to handle input sizes up to $$10^6$$.
