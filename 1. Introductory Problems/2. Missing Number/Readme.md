# CSES Problem Set: Missing Number

## Task

You are given all numbers between $$1, 2, \ldots, n$$ except one. Your task is to find the missing number.

## Input

- The first input line contains an integer $$n$$.
- The second line contains $$n-1$$ numbers. Each number is distinct and between 1 and $$n$$ (inclusive).

### Constraints:
- $$2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5$$

## Output

Print the missing number.

## Example

### Input:
5 2 3 1 5


### Output:
4

### Notes:
- The task requires finding the missing number from a sequence of distinct numbers.
- Ensure the solution is efficient to handle the largest input size of $$n = 2 \times 10^5$$.
